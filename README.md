I have created this website for password generation. When click the generate password button, a series of prompts for password criteria will show up:<br />
  1. Ask you to choose a length of password between 8 and 128 and will validate your answers.<br />
  2. Ask you to include lowercase letters or not and will validate your answers.<br />
  3. Ask you to include uppercase letters or not and will validate your answers.<br />
  4. Ask you to inlcude numeric characters or not and will validate your answers.<br />
  5. Ask you to include special characters or not and will validate your answers.<br />

After all the prompts, it will also make sure you choose at least one character type. <br />
Then it will generate a password that matches the selected criteria and the password will be written to the page.
